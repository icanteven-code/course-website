# Courses Website

This is a learning project using the [Course Template 🟣 by Flowbase.co](https://www.figma.com/community/file/877755494185998698). 

This project is created exclusively for learning and the target is to show the workflow of creating a somewhat real page via HTML, CSS & JS. No fancy (and unnecessary) frameworks will be used. I want to play around with a couple of things I can't use for my day-to-day work, like Parcel, Open Props CSS, etc. 

These will be marked as "features" and we'll be learning and working with them in the process of building the whole website.
